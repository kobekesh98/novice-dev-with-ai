## What This Is

This is not just a code repository. It is a **complete learning environment** that combines:

- A structured HTML and CSS curriculum (8 modules)
- A pre-configured AI agent system for teaching and code review
- Real project exercises you build yourself
- A GitHub-based workflow that mirrors how professional developers work

The AI tools in this repository are configured to **teach you**, not do the work for you.
Every agent, every prompt, and every workflow is designed around one principle:

> **Understanding > Memorization > Code Generation**

---

## Understanding the .claude Folder

When you clone this repo, you will see a `.claude/` folder in the sidebar.
**Do not edit anything inside it.** Here is what it is and why it matters.

The `.claude/` folder is the **AI's instruction manual** for this classroom.
Every time you use Antigravity IDE or Claude in this repo, the AI reads this
folder automatically and behaves like a tutor configured for this exact course.

### What's Inside .claude/

```
.claude/
├── CLAUDE.md              ← The AI's main brain — defines how it teaches
├── WORKFLOWS.md           ← Step-by-step lesson and session workflows
├── agents/                ← 30 specialized AI assistants
│   ├── html-educator.md   ← Your HTML tutor
│   └── css-educator.md    ← Your CSS tutor
├── contexts/              ← Templates YOU use to start AI sessions
│   ├── student.md         ← ⭐ Copy this before EVERY AI chat
│   └── teacher.md         ← Instructor-facing prompts
├── rules/                 ← The standards your code is reviewed against
│   ├── html/html-standards.md
│   └── css/css-standards.md
└── skills/                ← 125 knowledge skills the AI draws from
```

### The One File You Will Use Daily: `student.md`

Open `.claude/contexts/student.md`. It contains a template like this:

```
I am a beginner HTML student on Module [X].
Today I am trying to [describe goal].
My current code: [paste your code]
What I've already tried: [list attempts]
My question: [specific question]
```

Copy this template, fill in the blanks, and paste it as your **first message**
in every Antigravity or Claude chat. This tells the AI exactly who you are
and gets you a much better answer than just asking a vague question.

### Rules for the .claude Folder

| You CAN... | You CANNOT... |
|---|---|
| Read any file inside it | Edit any file inside it |
| Use `student.md` as a prompt template | Create new files inside it |
| Ask the AI to explain what's in it | Delete or rename anything |

> The `.claude/` folder is teacher-managed. If something seems wrong with how the AI
> is behaving, tell your instructor — do not try to fix it yourself.

---

## What You Will Learn

---

## Student Workflow — Your Daily 8 Steps

Follow this exact sequence at the start of **every** class session:

```
Step 1 → Pull the latest changes from the instructor
         git pull upstream main

Step 2 → Switch to your personal branch
         git checkout student/your-name

Step 3 → Open your folder in VS Code
         student-projects/your-name/

Step 4 → Start Live Server
         Right-click index.html → "Open with Live Server"
         Your browser opens and auto-refreshes as you code

Step 5 → Read today's lesson notes BEFORE writing any code
         Open: curriculum/module-0X/lesson-notes.md

Step 6 → Prime the AI with your context
         Copy .claude/contexts/student.md
         Fill in: module, goal, your current code, your question
         Paste it as your first message to Antigravity

Step 7 → Code, save, and inspect constantly
         Ctrl+S after every small change
         F12 to open DevTools and inspect what changed
         Try to fix bugs yourself before asking the AI

Step 8 → Commit your work at the end of every session
         git add .
         git commit -m "add: what you built today"
         git push origin student/your-name
```

### Example of a Good Student Session

**Bad version:**
> Student opens Antigravity and types: *"Write me a navbar"*
> AI writes 50 lines. Student copies it. Student learns nothing.

**Good version:**
> Student reads `curriculum/module-04-flexbox/lesson-notes.md` first.
> Student tries to write the navbar themselves for 10 minutes.
> Student opens Antigravity and types:
>
> ```
> I am on Module 4 — Flexbox. I'm trying to build a navigation bar
> with the logo on the left and links on the right.
> I've tried: display: flex on the <nav>, but both logo and links
> are on the left side.
> My HTML: <nav><span>Logo</span><ul><li>Home</li><li>About</li></ul></nav>
> My CSS: nav { display: flex; }
> What am I missing? Give me a hint.
> ```
>
> AI gives a hint → student finds the fix → student understands Flexbox better.

---

## How to Clone and Contribute

### Step 1 — Fork the Repository

1. Go to: `https://github.com/[instructor-username]/novice-dev-with-ai`
2. Click the **Fork** button (top right)
3. This creates your own copy under your GitHub account

### Step 2 — Clone Your Fork to Your Computer

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/novice-dev-with-ai.git
```

Move into the folder:

```bash
cd novice-dev-with-ai
```

### Step 3 — Set the Original Repo as "Upstream"

This lets you pull updates from the instructor later:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/[instructor-username]/novice-dev-with-ai.git
```

Verify both remotes:

```bash
git remote -v
```

You should see `origin` (your fork) and `upstream` (instructor's repo).

### Step 4 — Create Your Personal Branch

```bash
git checkout -b student/your-name
```

Replace `your-name` with your actual name, all lowercase, hyphens for spaces:
- `student/john-doe`
- `student/amara-mensah`

### Step 5 — Create Your Project Folder

```bash
mkdir -p student-projects/your-name
cd student-projects/your-name
```

Create your first two files:

```bash
# On Windows (Command Prompt or PowerShell):
New-Item index.html
New-Item style.css
```

Or just create them in VS Code: File → New File → save as `index.html` inside your folder.

### Step 6 — Open Your Project in VS Code

```bash
# From the root of the repo:
code .
```

Or open VS Code, then File → Open Folder → select `novice-dev-with-ai`.

### Step 7 — Start Live Server

1. Open `student-projects/your-name/index.html` in VS Code
2. Right-click inside the file
3. Select **"Open with Live Server"**
4. Your browser opens at `http://127.0.0.1:5500/` — this auto-refreshes as you code

### Step 8 — Make Your First Commit

After writing some code:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "add: my first HTML page"
git push origin student/your-name
```

### Step 9 — Submit a Pull Request (When Milestone Is Complete)

1. Go to your fork on GitHub.com
2. Click **"Compare & Pull Request"** (it appears after you push)
3. Set:
   - Base repository: `instructor/novice-dev-with-ai` → branch: `main`
   - Head repository: `your-fork` → branch: `student/your-name`
4. Title: `[Your Name] — Module [X] Complete`
5. Description: What you built, what you learned, any questions you have
6. Click **Create Pull Request**

## How to Use AI Tools Responsibly

AI tools in this classroom are **configured as mentors, not ghostwriters**.

### The AI Will Always:
- Explain concepts BEFORE showing code
- Give hints instead of full answers when you're stuck
- Ask you to explain code back before moving forward
- Celebrate what you got right before correcting mistakes
- Use plain English — no unexplained jargon

### You Must Always:
- Read the AI's explanation before copying any code
- Type code yourself (no copy-paste from AI)
- Try to fix bugs on your own before asking for help
- Be specific about what you've already tried

### Good AI Prompts (Memorize These)

```
"Explain what [concept] is in plain English before showing code."

"Show me the smallest example of [X]. Under 20 lines. Comment every new concept."

"My [element] is [not doing X]. I've tried [Y] and [Z].
 Here's my code: [paste]. Give me a hint, not the answer."

"Review my HTML using the beginner checklist.
 Tell me what I did well and one thing to improve."
```

### Prompts That Will Slow Your Learning (Avoid These)

```
❌ "Write my full project for me"
❌ "Fix all the bugs in my code"
❌ "Give me the final version of [X]"
❌ "Just give me the answer"
```

### The 3-Before-AI Rule

Before opening the AI chat, you must do three things:
1. Re-read the lesson notes for this module
2. Try one more approach on your own
3. Read the error message or inspect in Chrome DevTools

This rule makes you a stronger developer over time.
The best developers write better AI prompts because they understand the problem.
